SASS-based CSS & JS Framework that we use on client projects

Currently in the process of a complete redesign

Principles of the new design:
1. No uneccsary abstractions. i.e. Minimise pre-defined grid components - the new css grid element mostly does away with the need for any framework to structure and implement grids. Only use it where you wish to enfore grid rules with sass helpers for example.
2. Design for the latest browsers - ensures you take advantage of their creative capabilites (h/t Rachel Andrew)
3. Have solid fallbacks in place for old browsers
4. Make it as lightweight and performance focused
5. Utilise OO/Atomic Design patterns - e.g. pattern lab, itcss
6. Focus on simple and intuitive sass naming - simplified version of BEM perhaps
7. Add Animation as a core component
8. Accessibility at the heart
9. Fully responsive Typographic




Inspired by Rock Hammer but slowly making it my own!
