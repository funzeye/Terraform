SASS-based CSS Pattern Library that we use on client projects

Currently in the process of a complete redesign

Package Manager Used: Yarn

Principles of the new design:
1. No uneccesary abstractions. i.e. For example get rid of any grid scss components - use new CSS Grid element
2. Design for the latest browsers - ensures you take advantage of their creative capabilites (h/t Rachel Andrew)
3. Have solid fallbacks in place for old browsers - progressive enhancement
4. Make it lightweight and performance focused
5. Utilise OO type folder structure for our SCSS - e.g. 7-1, itcss
6. Focus on simple and intuitive sass naming - simplified version of BEM perhaps
7. Add Animation as a core component
8. Accessibility at the heart
9. Fully responsive Typography
